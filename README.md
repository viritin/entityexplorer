# Entity Explorer

A general purpose "database browser" for Spring Boot apps that works on JPA level (~ uses JPA &amp; JPQL instead of raw JDBC/SQL). It can be dropped to a Spring Boot application during development (easier to see what is happening in DB and to make tiny ad hoc changes to the test data) or even to implement a very generic view for administrators, to replace raw "SQL UI" for less techical users.
